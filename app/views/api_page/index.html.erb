<h1>API stands for <i>a</i>pplication <i>p</i>rogramming <i>i</i>nterface</h1>

<div>
  Here I am going to try some out and see how its going!
</div>
<div>
<p>I am starting with the API from <a href='http://openweathermap.org/api'>OpenWeatherMap</a>.<br>
At first I have to read the documentation of the API, than I will assign some space in the view for the API and decide how it should look.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Sign up for an API key</li>
    <li>Read instructions for the usage carefully.</br> Like: store the requested data and just refresh after 10 min, 'cause the server capacity is limited. Good to know!</li>
    <li>Choose one of the given applications and start implementing it.</li>
  </ol>

<div class='weather-widget'>
  <h3>City of Berlin, Germany</h3>
  <img src='http://openweathermap.org/img/w/01d.png'>
  <h2>some degree </h2>
  clear or maybe not? <p></p>
  <div id='date'>get at which time?</div>
