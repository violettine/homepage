<div>
  I am starting with the <i>current weather</i> API from <a href='http://openweathermap.org/api'>OpenWeatherMap</a>.<br>
  At first I have to read the documentation of the API, than I will assign some space in the view for the API and decide how it should look.
</div>

<ol class='weather_widget_explanation'>
  <li>Sign up for an API key</li>
  <li>Read instructions for the usage carefully.</br> Like: store the requested data and just refresh after 10 min, 'cause the servers capacity is limited. Good to know!</li>
  <li>Choose one of the given applications and start implementing it.</li>
</ol>

<%= render 'weather/get_curr_weather' %>
